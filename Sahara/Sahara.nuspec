      Because your tests should be ridiculously easy to read and understand...

      Sahara is an assertion library that lets you write your unit tests in a more natural language syntax.
      Sahara is also an auto-mocking framework that makes it easier to test and refactor legacy code by helping you 
      isolate dependencies away from the classes you want to test.
